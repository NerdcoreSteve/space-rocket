Todo
    if my test player still doesn't like the "star jump"
        remove the stars from restartMode
        just draw a black background
    Draw "Press any key to continue"
    Destroyed mode should be changed to any-key mode
        it should say "Destroyed!" on one line, then "press any key" on the next
        Resize and reposition "Destroyed!" and "press any key..."
        have main.js provide an "any key" stream. Don't use filter any more.
        do stuff with the any key input value in restartMode
     refactor to use more redux-like pattern of streamed values
         each value in the stream will be an object with a type and it will have other
             attributes
     make asteroid appear randomly
         make a callback stream that puts a set of random numbers (and what the are for)
             into the input stream,
             call that callback from subscribe callback
             this is like the elm effects model
     make stream of asteroids that appear randomly
         garbage collect them when they go off screen
         is it ok for them to overlap?
     make a pause screen that shows game instructions and player stats
     Do I have a full game now?
         as soon as I do, I need to release it on heroku
             put up on digital ocean instead with a doman, make a trailer, publicize, etc?
    You can make the game more full screen if you remove the canvas css margin
     make a "let's make" video about what I've done?
     in-game tutorial bits that tell you to press up and down
     should have a registry of images and only start game when onload has completed for all
     make the asteroids have random sizes within a range
     asteroids move at different speeds
     tweak with frequency of new asteroid appearance
         should not be fixed. Should also be random
     rotate asteroids at different rates
         http:stackoverflow.com/questions/17411991/html5-canvas-rotate-image
         make rotate image function that takes an image and context
     make a set of asteroid images so they don't all look the same
     What else before I call it done?
     put up on heroku and porfolio

Todo later:
make a function that takes gamestate, canvas height and width,
and modifies game state dimensions appropriately
use it on initial state,
in subscribe: use it to modify state and canvas when window resizes
No functions will be able to rever to context.canvas, instead gamestate will
keep a record of canvas width and height
     keep improving, iterating, etc until people play it.
    TODO should render also be a switch based on mode?
    TODO get image dimensions by javascript
    rocketWidth = rocketLength * (48 / 122),  divide by image dimensions
