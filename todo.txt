Todo
    make a pause screen
        shows game instructions
    Do I have a full game now?
        as soon as I do, I need to release it on digital ocean instead with a doman,
            make a trailer, publicize, etc
            make a "let's make" video about what I've done
    game is a little choppy, what are some ideas to speed it up?
        only render on 'tick'
        don't use R.prop if you don't have to
        try not using array methods for map, filter, etc
        make your own versions of some of these functions optimized for your use
        try using a persistent data structure like immutable.js or the clojurescript one
    write tests for everything
        https://github.com/jhnns/rewire
            should allow you to test private module functions
        Do I need to test my little RxJs chain?
        How would I test render?
    How can I garuntee there will always be a way to get past the asteroids?
    show player stats on pause screen?
    nextAsteroidDuration should also be random?
    is it ok for asteroids to overlap?
    use collision rectangles slightly smaller than the image rects
    collision doesn't need screenHeight
    Soundtrack and sound effects
    You can make the game more full screen if you remove the canvas css margin
    in-game tutorial bits that tell you to press up and down?
        when you get the ability to shoot, tutorial should tell you to press space
    should have a registry of images and only start game when onload has completed for all
        maybe
        I should test the site in incognito mode. I want to make sure the game
    make the asteroids have random sizes within a range
    asteroids move at different speeds
    tweak with frequency of new asteroid appearance
        should not be fixed. Should also be random
    rotate asteroids at different rates
        http:stackoverflow.com/questions/17411991/html5-canvas-rotate-image
        make rotate image function that takes an image and context
    make a set of asteroid images so they don't all look the same
    What else before I call it done?
    put up on heroku and porfolio

Todo later:
make a function that takes gamestate, canvas height and width,
and modifies game state dimensions appropriately
use it on initial state,
in subscribe: use it to modify state and canvas when window resizes
No functions will be able to rever to context.canvas, instead gamestate will
keep a record of canvas width and height
    keep improving, iterating, etc until people play it.
    TODO should render also be a switch based on mode?
    TODO get image dimensions by javascript
    rocketWidth = rocketLength * (48 / 122),  divide by image dimensions
