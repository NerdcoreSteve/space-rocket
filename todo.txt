Todo
    if my test player still doesn't like the "star jump"
        remove the stars from restartMode
        just draw a black background
     make asteroid appear randomly, then make a stream of random asteroids
        bit by bit, put rocket, asteroid, etc in a field sub-object (like restart)
            just need to move rocket now
        then put asteroid in an asteroidField object
        asteroidField will hold the array of asteroids, appearanceFreq, and appearanceCounter
        create commands and effects arrays in gameState
        create a function called effects that takes gameState, processes those commands
            adds to the effects array and returns gamestate
        issue command to get a random y value for an asteroid appearance
        this is like the elm effects model
        garbage collect asteroids when they go off screen
        is it ok for them to overlap?
     make a pause screen that shows game instructions and player stats
     Do I have a full game now?
         as soon as I do, I need to release it on digital ocean instead with a doman,
            make a trailer, publicize, etc
            make a "let's make" video about what I've done
    write tests for everything
        https://github.com/jhnns/rewire
            should allow you to test private module functions
        Do I need to test my little RxJs chain?
        How would I test render?
    Soundtrack and sound effects
    You can make the game more full screen if you remove the canvas css margin
    could combine lenses with object spread to get rid of object spread nesting
        write post about it
    in-game tutorial bits that tell you to press up and down?
        when you get the ability to shoot, tutorial should tell you to press space
     should have a registry of images and only start game when onload has completed for all
        maybe
        I should test the site in incognito mode. I want to make sure the game
     make the asteroids have random sizes within a range
     asteroids move at different speeds
     tweak with frequency of new asteroid appearance
         should not be fixed. Should also be random
     rotate asteroids at different rates
         http:stackoverflow.com/questions/17411991/html5-canvas-rotate-image
         make rotate image function that takes an image and context
     make a set of asteroid images so they don't all look the same
     What else before I call it done?
     put up on heroku and porfolio

Todo later:
make a function that takes gamestate, canvas height and width,
and modifies game state dimensions appropriately
use it on initial state,
in subscribe: use it to modify state and canvas when window resizes
No functions will be able to rever to context.canvas, instead gamestate will
keep a record of canvas width and height
     keep improving, iterating, etc until people play it.
    TODO should render also be a switch based on mode?
    TODO get image dimensions by javascript
    rocketWidth = rocketLength * (48 / 122),  divide by image dimensions
