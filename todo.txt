Todo
    make asteroid appear randomly, then make a stream of random asteroids
        create a function called effects that takes gameState, processes those commands
            adds to the effects array and returns gamestate
            a reduce call does each effect until all effects are applied
        issue command to get a random y and nextDuration values for an asteroid appearance
            what about weighting some numbers so they appear more frequently?
                maybe do this later
        is it ok for asteroids to overlap?
    make a pause screen that shows game instructions and player stats
    use collision rectangles slightly smaller than the image rects
    Do I have a full game now?
        as soon as I do, I need to release it on digital ocean instead with a doman,
            make a trailer, publicize, etc
            make a "let's make" video about what I've done
    collision doesn't need screenHeight
    write tests for everything
        https://github.com/jhnns/rewire
            should allow you to test private module functions
        Do I need to test my little RxJs chain?
        How would I test render?
    Soundtrack and sound effects
    You can make the game more full screen if you remove the canvas css margin
    in-game tutorial bits that tell you to press up and down?
        when you get the ability to shoot, tutorial should tell you to press space
    should have a registry of images and only start game when onload has completed for all
        maybe
        I should test the site in incognito mode. I want to make sure the game
    make the asteroids have random sizes within a range
    asteroids move at different speeds
    tweak with frequency of new asteroid appearance
        should not be fixed. Should also be random
    rotate asteroids at different rates
        http:stackoverflow.com/questions/17411991/html5-canvas-rotate-image
        make rotate image function that takes an image and context
    make a set of asteroid images so they don't all look the same
    What else before I call it done?
    put up on heroku and porfolio

Todo later:
make a function that takes gamestate, canvas height and width,
and modifies game state dimensions appropriately
use it on initial state,
in subscribe: use it to modify state and canvas when window resizes
No functions will be able to rever to context.canvas, instead gamestate will
keep a record of canvas width and height
    keep improving, iterating, etc until people play it.
    TODO should render also be a switch based on mode?
    TODO get image dimensions by javascript
    rocketWidth = rocketLength * (48 / 122),  divide by image dimensions
